/* Problem 2g: Find names of all drinkers who frequent only those bars that serve some beers they like. */

1. get drinkers, bars, and the beers served there in a table (basically a frequents \join serves with some fancy projections)
2. (1) join likes to filter out for only tuples where the drinker likes the beer of the bar he's frequenting
3. project the drinkers out of 2

/* Problem 2h: Find names of all drinkers who frequent every bar that serves some beers they like. */

Same as above except no filter
